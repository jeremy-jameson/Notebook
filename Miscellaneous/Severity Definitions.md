Below is the severity list we came up with after working with the QA teams last year in order to be more crisp and have a shared definition for Ux bug severities.

| Sev 1 | Customers can’t use the feature. Whole system, product appears unstable. Inadvertent user action causes data loss. (i.e. no save prompt)                                          |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sev 2 | Customers are frustrated using the feature, the product appears poorly engineered or the feature is obviously inconsistent with other elements of product, suite UI. Hard to use. |
| Sev 3 | Customers annoyed by / aware of UI inconsistencies, the UI appears sloppy with poor fit and finish.                                                                               |
| Sev 4 | Little or no user impact.                                                                                                                                                         |
